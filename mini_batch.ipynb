    "It's also quite useful combined with SGD. The idea is to randomly shuffle the data at the start of each epoch, then create the mini-batches. For each mini-batch, you train the network weights with gradient descent. Since these batches are random, you're performing SGD with each batch.\n",

    "Unfortunately, it's sometimes impossible to divide the data into batches of exactly equal size. For example, imagine you'd like to create batches of 128 samples each from a dataset of 1000 samples. Since 128 does not evenly divide into 1000, you'd wind up with 7 batches of 128 samples, and 1 batch of 104 samples. (7*128 + 1*104 = 1000)\n",
